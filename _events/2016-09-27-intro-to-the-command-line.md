### Coffee and Code Workshop
   
Get familiar with the command line at the DHLab's next Coffee and Code! During the workshop, participants will learn the basics of the command line, including how to:

 * create, edit, and move files and directories
 * ssh (secure shell) to remote servers
 * navigate a computer's file system and more!

Windows computers will be available for use, though participants are welcome to bring their own computer (Windows or Mac).

**If you plan to use one of the available Windows machines, please arrive 5 minutes early to the workshop as they take a while to boot up.**
   
**Space is limited; to register, please go to the [YUL Instruction Calendar](http://schedule.yale.edu/event/2829853). Registration is open to Yale students, faculty, and staff; no prior programming experience is required.**
   
This workshop will be lead-in to our Intro to Git Coffee and Code on October 25 - keep an eye on our website for more information.
