### Coffee and Code Workshop
   
Visualize word frequencies at the DHLab's Coffee and Code. During the workshop, participants learned how to deploy Bookworm, a tool for analyzing trends in word or phrase frequencies over a designated time span. Sample text files were provided, but participants were encouraged to bring their own data for discussion.

No prior programming experience was required.
