 During Office Hours, Tracy MacMath and Joseph StadolnikÂ presented on digital humanities courses they participated in over the summer. Beginning with design, Tracy discussed "Accessibility and Digital Environments," a course offered at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) that addressed how to design digital projects for all users. Moving from design to implementation, Joseph then provided an overview of "Humanities Programming," a course given at the Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching (HILT) institute that was aimed at deploying web-based applications.

Both courses will be offered again at next year's [DHSI](http://www.dhsi.org/) and HILT, so this was an opportunity to hear what they were like and to learn more about the DHLab's Training Scholarships.
   
Coffee and tea were provided!
