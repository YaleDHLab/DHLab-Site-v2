*April 12, 1:30-3:30pm,* Zhang Auditorium, School of Management
     
Led by Holly Rushmeier (Yale Computer Science/IPCH Digitization Lab), this Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage panel will discuss the great and fundamental questions about human history, behavior, and enterprise that can, for the first time, be posed and answered using cultural heritage data in conjunction with the vast data processing and storage capabilities of the Information Age. It will discuss the advances in heritage preservation that could be made by resources and research emerging from modern data science and information technology.
