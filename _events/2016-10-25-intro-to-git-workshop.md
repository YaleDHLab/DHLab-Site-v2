Learn how to use Git at the DHLab's next Coffee and Code! During the workshop, DH Developer Douglas Duhaime will cover the fundamentals of Git â€” a free, open source version control system. Participants will learn how to create repositories and branches, manage pull requests, and commit changes.
   
Git provides a robust system for collaborating with team members and finding existing code that you might adopt and adapt for your own projects.
