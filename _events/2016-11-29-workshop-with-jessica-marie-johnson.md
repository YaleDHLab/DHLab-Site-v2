### Radical Media and Social Change: A Digital Humanities Workshop 


How can technological platforms connect investigations of the past to transformative justice in the present? How might the digital humanities promote intersectional research and tell the stories of marginalized subjects? This hands-on, interactive workshop offers participants the opportunity to explore these questions under the guidance of Jessica Marie Johnson, professor of Africana Studies and History at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in the digital humanities. Drawing upon Professor Johnson’s areas of expertise, we’ll also discuss incorporating digital and social media into one’s teaching, establishing productive collaborations with other scholars, and using digital platforms to facilitate public engagement. Participants are encouraged to bring examples of their own work (DH projects, websites, etc.), as well as questions for Professor Johnson about how to establish a digital presence as an emerging scholar.

**Space for the workshop is limited. To register, please visit the [YUL Instruction Calendar](http://schedule.yale.edu/event/2966935). Registration is open to Yale students, faculty, and staff.**

Co-organizers: Lucy Caplan (African American Studies and American Studies) and Brandi M. Waters (African American Studies and History)
