Our workshop explores the intersection of Digital Humanities and Russian and East European Studies: research, pedagogy, dissemination, and archive. We invite participants to join us in considering a list of questions and topics of discussion, ranging from the familiar and unavoidable (labor, ethics, access, funding, training, institutional, and interdisciplinary challenges) to the specific (theoretical continuities and disciplinary embeddedness).

All are welcome to attend! This event is open to the public.
