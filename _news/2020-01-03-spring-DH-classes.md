### Blake and Milton
ENGL 223, HSAR 479  
John Rogers  
DH Fellow Sarah Weston  

An interdisciplinary exploration of the Romantic poet William Blake and his literary and visual engagements with the work of the Renaissance poet John Milton. Relying on the unique Blake holdings at the Yale Center for British Art, the course considers not only Blake’s Milton, but Blake’s artistic and textual treatments of other early modern writers, including Shakespeare, Bacon, Bunyan, and Newton.  

### Deserts, Oceans, Islands: Literature of Migration & Refuge
AFST 369, MMES 369, FREN 369  
Jill Jarvis  
DH Fellow Carole Delaitre  

A critical study of literature and film that charts different spaces shaped by intersecting—or colliding—routes of colonization and forced migration: deserts (Sahara, Sonoran), oceans (Indian, Atlantic, Mediterranean), and islands (Haiti, Martinique, Zanzibar, Mauritius, Sri Lanka). Students contribute to the Desert Futures interdisciplinary symposium to be held at Yale in spring 2020. Seminar is conducted in English.  

Prerequisite: Reading knowledge of French required (FREN 160 or above; contact instructor with questions about language preparation).  

### Fake News and True Stories
FREN 391  
Christophe Schuwey  

The rise of newspapers and the development of the information culture in the age of Versailles deeply transformed French literature and the relationship of readers to truth and fiction. On the one hand, reading the news became a leisure activity, which created issues surprisingly similar to our contemporary 'fake news' phenomenon. On the other hand, realism became the new paradigm for literature, as audiences craved stories and plays depicting their own world. Authors turned information, rumors, and gossip into novels, comedies, and tragedies. Through works by Molière, La Fayette, Donneau de Visé, Scudéry, Racine, and Corneille as well as the first newspapers, we explore this critical moment that built our modern relationship to fiction and information.  

### Reading and Writing the Modern Essay
ENGL 120  
DH Fellow Trina Hyun  

Close reading of great nonfiction prepares students to develop mastery of the craft of powerful writing in the humanities and in all fields of human endeavor, within the university and beyond. Study of some of the finest essayists in the English language, including James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Leslie Jamison, Jhumpa Lahiri, George Orwell, David Foster Wallace, and Virginia Woolf. Assignments challenge students to craft persuasive arguments from personal experience, to portray people and places, and to interpret fundamental aspects of modern culture. Preregistration required; see under English Department.  

### Reading in Literary Japanese
JAPN 171, JAPN 170  
DH Fellow Nina Farizova  

Close analytical reading of a selection of texts from the Nara through the Tokugawa periods: prose, poetry, and various genres. Introduction to kanbun.  

Prerequisite: After JAPN 170 or equivalent.  

### Writing Seminars: Shaping Voices
ENGL 114  
DH Fellow Melissa Tu  

Instruction in writing well-reasoned analyses and academic arguments, with emphasis on the importance of reading, research, and revision. Using examples of nonfiction prose from a variety of academic disciplines, individual sections focus on topics such as the city, childhood, globalization, inequality, food culture, sports, and war. Preregistration required.    

### YData: An Introduction to Data Science
CPSC 123, PLSC 351, S&DS 123, S&DS 523  
Jessi Cisewski-Kehe  

Computational, programming, and statistical skills are no longer optional in our increasingly data-driven world; these skills are essential for opening doors to manifold research and career opportunities. This course aims to dramatically enhance knowledge and capabilities in fundamental ideas and skills in data science, especially computational and programming skills along with inferential thinking. YData is an introduction to Data Science that emphasizes the development of these skills while providing opportunities for hands-on experience and practice. YData is accessible to students with little or no background in computing, programming, or statistics, but is also engaging for more technically oriented students through extensive use of examples and hands-on data analysis. Python 3, a popular and widely used computing language, is the language used in this course. The computing materials will be hosted on a special purpose web server.
