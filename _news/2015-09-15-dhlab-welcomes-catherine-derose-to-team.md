The Digital Humanities Lab is excited to announce that [Catherine DeRose](https://catherinederose.wordpress.com/) has joined on as our Engagement and Outreach Manager. Catherine is coming to Yale from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she is finishing a PhD in English literature. Her current research considers how Victorian authors thought about text preservation during the print explosion in the nineteenth-century and how the concerns (and solutions) they raised reonate with issues surrounding archives and mass digitization today. Catherine has been actively involved in digital humanities initiatives at Madison, as well as at Carnegie Hall and the Folger Shakespeare Library.
   
Her office is in Sterling Memorial Library, 316. Please stop by or send her an email if you have project ideas, something you would like to see from the lab, or just want to say "hello"!
