The Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to share that Gideon Fink Shapiro has joined on as one of our Postdoctoral Associates. Gideon earned a Ph.D. in Architecture (history and theory) from the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, where his dissertation research traced the confluence of garden art and urban planning in the public parks of Paris. Gideon's project at the DHLab, "Gathering a Building," seeks to visualize the multi-dimensional context of architectural design and construction. It takes as a case study the two new residential colleges currently under construction on the campus of Yale University, scheduled to open in Fall 2016. The project uses archival and original data to expand notions of "site" and "building," beyond their conventional definitions, in the form of a web exhibit.
   
Gideon will be working in the DHLab (Sterling Memorial Library, 316). Please stop by to welcome him!
