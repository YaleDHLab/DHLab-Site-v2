The Digital Humanities Lab and Center for Teaching and Learning are putting together an informal working group to brainstorm, design, and build a Jekyll-based web application this summer. Our goal is to gather a group interested in digital work in order to collectively construct a fun proof of concept application using Jekyll and JavaScript.
   
This will be a great opportunity for each member of the group to learn about Jekyll—which offers an easy introduction to web programming—and to collectively have some fun while building something useful to others. All levels of programming experience, from beginner to advanced, are welcome.
   
If you are interested in joining, **send a quick email to [dhlab@yale.edu](mailto:dhlab@yale.edu) by June 6**, so that we count you in for our initial planning meeting!
