The Digital Humanities Lab is delighted to announce the three Postdoctoral Associates who will be joining the DHLab team for the 2017-2018 academic year. While here, the postdocs will pursue digital humanities research relevant to their academic disciplines, with a Yale faculty member serving as a mentor.

### Nadya Bair 
A historian of photography and the press, Nadya Bair holds a Ph.D. in Art History from the University of Southern California. Her book project, *The Decisive Network: Magnum Photos and the Postwar Image Market*, examines the role of photo agencies in shaping postwar visual culture. Based on years of research in archives around the world, *The Decisive Network* looks beyond heroic photographers and their iconic images to demonstrate how a range of professionals brought the aesthetic and production mode of news images into multiple markets for photography. At Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab, Bair will be mining data from thousands of pages of Magnum business correspondence in order to visualize and analyze the full scope of the agency’s networks. Working on a scale that exceeds the limits of chronological and linear narrative, this project will model new ways to study image saturation and the collaborative labor that yielded it.
*Nadya will join the lab on August 1, 2017.*


### Damon Crockett
Damon Crockett's present work concerns the role of visual evidence in the social sciences. In particular, he considers the ways in which image data can be used to ground substantive explanations in fields like media studies, cultural studies, and digital art history. During his appointment with the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, Damon plans to develop a set of flexible software tools for the direct visualization of image data. Additionally, he will conduct an in-depth user study aimed at making the tools as useful and learnable as possible.
*Damon will join the lab on September 1, 2017.*


### Gabor Toth
Gabor Toth (currently a fellow of the German Historical Institute in Washington, DC) will join the DHLab in October 2017. His background spans both Digital Humanities and History. During his dual appointment in the DHLab and Fortunoff Video Archive, Gabor will work on a digital tool that will enable the exploration of a big collection of interviews with Holocaust survivors. Besides, Gabor will prepare a monograph on the computer-assisted analysis of Holocaust interviews.
*Gabor will join the lab on October 1, 2017.*
