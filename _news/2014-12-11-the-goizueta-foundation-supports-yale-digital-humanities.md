Yale University Library received a $3 million award from [The Goizueta Foundation](http://www.goizuetafoundation.org/) to fund the creation of the Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) in Sterling Memorial Library. Yale’s world-class collections offer unparalleled source material for humanistic inquiries. With the launch of the DHLab in fall 2015, we can now push these inquiries further by incorporating digital methods that allow us to see our (literary, historical, cultural, artistic) data at new scales. The Goizueta Foundation, which was founded in 1992 by Roberto Goizueta (Yale '53), provides financial support to innovative non-profit organizations in order to promote lasting change in education and family services.
