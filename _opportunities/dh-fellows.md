      <p>Each semester, the Digital Humanities Lab appoints a cohort of Digital Humanities Fellows to assist with courses that have a strong digital humanities component. These positions provide semester-long support for graduate students to engage with digital humanities methods and theories in a classroom setting. DHLab staff will work with Fellows to design digital humanities assignments, arrange access to electronic content, and provide specialized technical training. Visit the <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/about/teaching_fellows.html' target='_blank'>DH Teaching Fellows page</a> under "About" to see our current recipients and their courses.</p>

  {% capture left_text_one %}
    <p>Fellows are responsible for introducing digital humanities approaches into their class. As a Fellow, you are required to meet with Digital Humanities Lab staff at least once before the semester starts to discuss goals (for the course as well as yourself), look through a syllabus, and identify what methods/theories you will introduce to students. Prior to your teaching the students, DHLab staff will work with you and your cohort to provide training sessions and consider ways to teach the material.</p> 

    <p>Fellows are also expected to attend occasional "cohort" meetings during the semester, which are opportunities to learn about what everyone is doing in their classes and to share any successes or challenges you encounter.</p>
